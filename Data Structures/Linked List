Linked lists are an ordered collection of objects. 
So what makes them different from normal lists? Linked lists differ from lists in the way that they store elements in memory.
While lists use a contiguous memory block to store references to their data, linked lists store references as part of their own elements.

Each element of a linked list is called a Node, and every node has two different fields:
-DATA : contains the value to be stored in the node.
-NEXT : contains a reference to the next node on the list.
